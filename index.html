<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How can you help?</h3>

<p>On the Sentue Server we have a lot of players that wish to help make more games, However not everyone has the skills to build the mini-games so to help if you have a really ground breaking idea there is something you can do. First you will need to create a presentation this can be a video or a powerpoint convincing us that this NEEDS to be added to the server. Once you have your presentation prepared for us write a word document consisting of all the ideas you have had for this game the concept of how it works and anything else you think we should know. Then put these things and anything else you wish to add into a zip file and upload it here http://sentue.com/suggestions</p>
